# Expenses chart component challenge
In this challenge I needed to build an expenses chart looking as close to the [challenge's photos](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt)

Built with React, I used the json data provided with the challenge and programmed the graph charts' height and color to be dynamic, according to the expenses on a certain day.
